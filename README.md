🧠 Theracord CRM is a custom-built, therapist-focused client management system I designed to handle client profiles, session tracking, and payment logging.
Built with Vue.js on the frontend and a Laravel + MySQL backend, it brings clarity and ease-of-use to the client management process—with a clean, intuitive UI designed to feel lightweight and welcoming.
💖 Features I’m Proud Of:
👀 At-a-Glance Info That Feels Personal
 Each client card uses soft colors and simple icons to display contact details and notes, making the information feel approachable and human without overwhelming the user.


📊 Dashboard Widgets That Highlight What Matters
 On each client’s profile page, I included focused stat cards showing total sessions, charged fees, payments, and remaining balances—bringing the most important data front and center.


🔁 Clean Layout Without Repetition
 Even though sessions and payments share some structure, the design and layout keep things feeling fresh. Sections are visually separated, so the interface doesn’t feel monotonous or overwhelming.
🔮 What I’d Do Next:
📝 Expand Session Detail Views
 Right now, sessions are listed with dates and fees—but I’d love to make them clickable so you can pull up session notes, duration, and other key details in a dedicated view or modal.


✏️ Edit on the Fly
 I want to add full editing capabilities for both sessions and payments. That way, therapists could update incorrect data or adjust session notes directly from the client profile view.


💵 Payment Transparency
 Clicking on a payment should open a quick breakdown: when it was received, how it was split between client and insurance, and which session(s) it was tied to.



🛠 Tech & Tools Used
Vue 3 + Script Setup
 Built using Vue’s composition API for a clean, modern structure that scales well.
